Hi, my name is Greg Kroah-Hartman. I work with the Linux foundation as a fellow.
            大家好，我的名字叫Greg Kroah-Hartman。我在Linux基金会工作。
I am a Linux kernel developer. I release stable Linux kernels as well as doing (do) other driver development.
            我是一个Linux内核开发者，我负责发布Linux内核稳定版本和其他驱动开发。
Linux releases development kernel about once every three months, I do the stable kernels about once every week.
            Linux大约每3个月发布开发版内核，我每周在做稳定版内核的工作。Linux大约每三个月发布一次开发版内核，而我是每周进行一次稳定版的开发。
I got involved with Linux many years ago. I used to use it where I worked.
       我在多年前就接触了Linux，我在以往的工作中也使用Linux 。
I was a programmer. I invented embedded devices, firmware for embedded devices.
            我是一个程序员，我以前是开发嵌入式设备和其固件的。
I had to interact my devices with all sorts of operating systems. Linux was just coming around. It was just getting USB support.
            我必须在各种操作系统上调试我的设备。那时我刚接触Linux。它刚支持USB设备。
I was just creating a USB device. I had to get it to work.
            我刚做出一个USB设备，我得让它工作起来。
I had contributed a patch to make the change and it was accepted and I was like hey, that's great!
           我曾为修改一些东西提交了一个补丁，并成功被（Linux源）接受了，然后我觉得，hey, 这挺不错的！
Over time I submitted more and more patches and I wrote a driver for a device which
渐渐地，我提交越来越多的patch，我还写了一个硬件驱动，因为我在我自己的电脑上用Linux，而Linux还不支持这种硬件
Linux didn't support because I was using Linux on my own desktop.

Suddenly, over time I realized that more people were using my device for free than
突然间，我意识到免费使用我的设备的人要比用任何我之前领了工资做的要多，因为我曾工作过的公司从来都做不好。
anything that I ever got paid for because the companies that I worked for never did very well.

And dot com boom started and there was more and more need for Linux developers.
然后，网络热潮开始了，Linux开发者的需求越来越大
I got a job being a Linux kernel developer full-time and I haven't looked back since.
我得到了一个Linux内核开发者的全职工作，从此再也没有回头过
It's been a great great opportunity and I really enjoy doing this.
这是一个绝佳的机会，我非常享受地去做
Linux is an operating system and its core is just a kernel. It talks to the hardware makes the hardware work.
Linux是一个操作系统，它的核心部分只是一个内核，内核与硬件交流，让硬件能工作起来
It makes it able for you to run programs and do what you want to do.
内核让你能运行程序，做你想做的事
It's very unique in the fact that there are lots of other operating systems out there but our development community is very different.
现在有很多别的操作系统，但我们的开发社区是很不一样的 —— 这是非常独特的事实
We have over 2000 developers every year contributing to it from over 400 may be 500 companies.
           每年，我们有来自400甚至500家公司的2000名开发者的贡献
It is the single largest software project in the history of mankind.
           这是人类历史上最大的独立软件项目（少了single 不知道咋加进去，sry，我去搬运了）
We contribute at the rate of about (what are we) about ten patches a day, twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, go into this code.
我们以一天大约10个补丁的速度，24*7地为Linux贡献代码。
It's constantly updated, constantly revised, constantly changing because the world changes.
它（？）一直在更新，不断被修订，不停地改变，因为这世界在不停地改变
We have to react to a change in world. If an operating system stops change and of course if the world doesn't stop changing it will die.
我们必须对这个世界的每项改变作出应对。当世界从不停止改变时，如果一个操作系统停止了改变，那它就会灭亡。
Linux constantly is improved, constantly is updated in order to handle the changing world.
为了应对这日新月异的世界，Linux在不端地提高，不断地更新
The more you know about Linux the better off you can be. Linux is used everywhere and we need help using it.
//谁来翻这句
//better off要怎么解释。状况越好？
你越了解Linux，你会变更好。Linux被广泛地使用而我们需要帮助（他人）使用它。
There is almost no part of the world that does not use Linux. If you have skills in Linux we have tons of jobs out there.
这世界上几乎没有地方不用到Linux，如果你有Linux相关的技能，就会有数不清的工作在等着你。
We need people who are programmers, we need people who are sys admins, we need people to document the stuff,
我们需要程序员，需要系统管理员，需要人来写文档
we need people to test the stuff and it's a fun thing to play with. You can play with it and create things out of it.
我们需要人来测试。做这些事情是很有趣的。你甚至可以创造出超过这些的事情。
So you also can have fun while you are doing it.
所以在你做的时候会有很多乐趣
And it will help feel that you are part of a larger community that's doing something great.
而且这会让你觉得，你是属于一个很大的团体，正在做着很伟大的东西
This course will teach the fundamentals of what Linux is; how to use the command line; how to use the graphical interface.
本课程会教你一些关于Linux是什么，如何使用命令行，如何使用图形界面的基础
It is self-guided; you can sign up for it at anytime and take it at your own pace. Thank you for your interest in Linux.
课程是自导的 你可以在任何时候注册，在你的空余时间进行，。感谢你对Linux的兴趣
I hope you enjoy the course. Linux is a wonderful experience. It provides great opportunities for jobs,
